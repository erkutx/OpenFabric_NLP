# main.py Documentation

## Explanation

The Python code in `main.py` demonstrates a text preprocessing and analysis process using the spaCy library for tokenization and extraction of nouns and adjectives, and the WordNet database for finding synonyms and definitions. The breakdown of the code's functionality is as follows:

1. **Importing spaCy**: The code starts by importing the spaCy library, which is used for natural language processing tasks.
2. **Loading Language Model**: The English language model "en_core_web_sm" is loaded using spaCy and saved into the 'nlp' variable for further text processing.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `preprocess_and_analyze_text(text)` is defined to take a text input, tokenize it using spaCy, extract nouns and adjectives, find synonyms and definitions for these extracted words using WordNet, and generate a response string with the results.

4. **Text Processing Steps**: Within the function, the input text is tokenized using spaCy's 'nlp' object, creating a 'doc' object. Nouns and adjectives are extracted from the tokenized text based on their part of speech tags. For each noun and adjective found, synonyms and definitions are fetched from WordNet and added to the response string. The response string is returned at the end of the function.

5. **Example Usage**: An example text "hello is a great way to start" is provided as input, and the `preprocess_and_analyze_text` function is called with this input text. The output string containing the found nouns, adjectives, synonyms, and definitions is stored in the 'output' variable, and then printed to the console.

## File Description

- `main.py`: This file contains the main script for text preprocessing and analysis.

## Imports

- `spacy`: Imported to load the English language model for text processing.

## Function Definitions

- `preprocess_and_analyze_text`:
  - This function tokenizes input text, extracts nouns and adjectives, finds synonyms and definitions, and constructs a response.

## Example Usage

```python
input_text = "hello, is a great way to start "
output = preprocess_and_analyze_text(input_text)
print(output)
```

**Output**:

```
Here are the synonyms and definitions for the nouns and adjectives in your text:

Noun: way
Synonyms: manner, mode, style, fashion
Definition: how something is done or how it happens

Adjective: great
Synonyms:
Definition: a person who has achieved distinction and honor in some field
```

## Overall Workflow

The `preprocess_and_analyze_text` function is used to analyze the input text by extracting nouns and adjectives, finding synonyms and definitions, and generating a response. External dependencies include the `en_core_web_sm` model from spaCy and WordNet for synonym and definition retrieval.
